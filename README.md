Welcome to my personal journey into the world of **C programming**. This repository is a growing collection of everything I’m learning — from basic syntax to advanced system-level programming. It includes code samples, exercises, and projects that track my progress toward mastering the C language.

---

## 📚 Roadmap

### ✅ Phase 1: C Language Basics (2-4 Weeks)
> **Goal:** Master syntax, variables, conditionals, loops, arrays, strings, and functions.

📁 `phase-1/`
- Variables & Data Types
- Control Flow (if, while, for)
- Arrays & Strings
- Functions
- Projects:
  - Mini Calculator
  - Quiz System
  - Student Database
  - Custom String Library

---

### ✅ Phase 2: Intermediate C Concepts (3-5 Weeks)
> **Goal:** Understand pointers, dynamic memory allocation, file I/O, and basic data structures.

📁 `phase-2/`
- Pointers & Pointer Arithmetic
- Dynamic Memory (`malloc`, `free`, `realloc`)
- File Handling (`fopen`, `fwrite`, `fread`)
- Structs & Linked Lists
- Projects:
  - Text Editor (Pointer-based)
  - Student Management (Dynamic Memory)
  - File-Based To-Do List
  - Phonebook Using Linked Lists

---

### 🔄 Phase 3: Advanced C Concepts (4-6 Weeks)
> **Goal:** Learn data structures, multi-threading, system programming, and performance optimization.

📁 `phase-3/`
- Linked Lists, Trees, Stacks, Queues, Graphs
- Multi-threading (POSIX Threads)
- Process Management (`fork`, `exec`, `pipes`, `signals`)
- Socket Programming (TCP/UDP)
- Bitwise Operations & Low-Level Optimization
- Projects:
  - Task Scheduler
  - Multi-Threaded File Downloader
  - Custom Unix Shell
  - Memory Manager
  - Web Server in C

---

## 🔧 Practice & Problem Solving

📁 `exercises/`
- Hands-on coding problems
- Algorithm practice
- Memory management drills
- File and string manipulation challenges

---

## 💡 What I’m Learning Along the Way
- Writing clean, modular C code
- Debugging with `gdb`, `valgrind`
- Understanding how memory and the system work
- Optimizing for speed and space
- Designing data structures from scratch

---

## 🛠 Tools & Environment
- GCC Compiler (`-Wall -Wextra -Werror`)
- Vim / VSCode
- Makefiles for compilation
- Git for version control

---

## 📌 Milestones
- [x] Wrote my first C program
- [x] Completed foundational C concepts
- [ ] Mastered pointers and dynamic memory
- [ ] Build a custom memory manager
- [ ] Create a fully working Unix-style shell
- [ ] Complete a web server using sockets
